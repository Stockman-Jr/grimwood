# Grimwood
Grimwood is a command line game in the genre of text-based adventure/survival.
It's the old but cliché story where the character wakes up in the middle of the woods with no memory of how they got there, and they're not alone.... 
The user will navigate through the story by typing an option of their choice in the command line when prompted to.
The goal of the game is to make the right choices and make it out of the woods alive.

## Features

### Existing Features


#### Start screen
The starting screen features an ascii art banner, and will ask the user to provide a name. The name will only be accepted if it only contains letters.
A short introduction message will then be displayed for the user, and let them know how to play the game.
The user will then be able to press enter to start the game.

The purpose of this is to introduce the user to the story and how to play the game.

#### Displaying text contents
Since this game is pretty heavy on the story part, I've done my best to make everything as clean and readable as possible using colorama library, whitespacing and new lines. The longer parts of the story are all colored text, and has been placed in a separate file to keep the main game file cleaner.
The purpose of this is to not overwhelm the user and provide them with a structured and clean output, so that it's easy to keep up.


#### Player options
The options provided will be displayed for the user along with a prompt that will mostly ask for a direction or a choice between a-d.

#### Winning and losing
If the user wins or lose the game, a function will be called to display a message. In both scenarios a prompt will also appear to ask the user if they want to play again, typing "yes" will restart the game, and any other key press will exit the game.



### Future Features
  * I would like to implement more types of user interactions to the game, maybe provide some puzzles for the user to solve.
  * More "rooms" and outcomes.

## Testing
Print statements were used heavily throughout the project to identify errors or check if code were working correctly.
Alot of the testing were also done in visual studio code, where I experimented with code and tested ideas.




### Validator Testing





### Bugs

#### Line too long, pep8
  * **Fix** - Fixed by either shortening the text or changing them to multiline.

#### Incorrect options displayed
  * **Expected** - The options provided for the user would be taken from a global list by slicing it to get the desired options.
  * **Testing** - Used print statements to make sure that I spliced the correct options.
  * **Fix** - Fixed by changing the numbers of the slice.

  * **Expected** - 
  * **Testing** - 
  * **Result** -
  * **Fix** -

## Deployment

This project was deployed using heroku, steps to deployment are as follows:
  * Sign up to heroku if you haven't, then check for a button labelled "New" at the top right of the dashboard.
  * Click that button to display a dropdown menu and select "Create New App".
  * This will take you to a new page, where you can enter your region and choose a name for your new app, which must be unique. Then click "Create App"
  * On the next page, navigate to the "Settings" tab on the menu, and find the section called "Config Vars"
  * Click on the button labelled "Config Vars" and add necessary key and value
  * For this program, only one config var was needed: "PORT" as key and "8000" as value. Then click "Add".
  * Navigate to "Buildpacks" underneath "Config Vars".
  * Click "Add buildpacks", and add python and node.js.
  * Make sure the the buildpacks are in the right order, with python at the top and node.js at the bottom, this is important. Save your changes.
  * Scroll back to the top menu and click the "Deploy" tab.
  * Here you'll have some options for deployment, I used github for this.
  * Once you've clicked on the Github button you will be able to search for your Github repository and connect to it.
  * Once connected, it's time to deploy. You can choose to deploy automatically or manually.
  * For this deployment I chose automatic, which will update everytime you push.
