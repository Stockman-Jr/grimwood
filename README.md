# Grimwood
Grimwood is a command line game in the genre of text-based adventure/survival.
It's the old but clich√© story where the character wakes up in the middle of the woods with no memory of how they got there, and they're not alone.... 
The user will navigate through the story by typing an option of their choice in the command line when prompted to.
The goal of the game is to make the right choices and make it out of the woods alive.
