            you suddenly feel the ground beneath you give in..
          
            "AAAaaahh"....
          
            You wake up to find yourself  at the bottom of a pitfall.

ENCOUNTER = ("""
            As you're crouched on the trail, proudly inspecting your newfound treasure, the hairs on your neck suddenly starts to rise..

HOUSE = ("""
           You start walking, continuing south off the path. 

           After a while you arrive at a small, abandoned house.  
           You might find something useful in there, you go inside...
     
           Dusty with lots of spiderwebs, how cozy. Looks like no one has set foot in there for some time.
          
           Handwritten notes and books are scattered everywhere, someone's been busy.

           You wonder what whomever was here was writing about, but it seems to be written in some language unkown to you.
         
           You look around...

HOUSE_ITEM = ("""
           You direct your flashlight towards the floor underneath the desk, and you notice something silver sticking out from a pile of notes.
           You put your flashlight down and crouch down to pick it up. 
          
           It looks like a very old flashlight in the shape of a square with a handle, you've never seen anything like it.
          
           There's some kind of switch on the back, you turn it and incredibly enough, it works!

           The light it emits is weak though, and it feels very strange.. Warm and comforting somehow.

HOUSE_ENCOUNTER = ("""
           You suddenly hear twigs cracking outside the broken window. 
           Something is outside.

           You take a deep breath and look toward the broken window. 
           You see the shape of a distorted lower body, violently muscular and covered in rippling shadows.

           You are frozen in horror, trying to decide what to do, when a huge clawed hand splinters the window frame.
           Looks like it's about to crouch and take a look inside.
