INTRO_MSG = ("""
 Your story begins with you waking up in the middle of a forest, 
 surrounded by the dark of the night with no memory of how you got there.

All you do know, as reality starts to sink in, is that you have to 
get out of there... alive.
           
Make the right choices, and you just might succeed.

            You walk towards the grove and stop at the entrace to look around, 
            the fruits looks delicious.
          
            As you start walking to pick up some fruit for your journey,
            you suddenly feel the ground beneath you give in..
          
            "AAAaaahh"....
          
            You wake up to find yourself  at the bottom of a pitfall. 
            You look up and see a pair of glowing eyes with a huge grin 
            looking down at you...

FOUND_ITEM = ("""
            You arrive at the source of the light you see a small leaf pile on 
            the left side of the trail where the light is emanating from.
          
            You dig through the leafpile and find a flashlight! A strong one 
            too, how strangely convenient!

ENCOUNTER = ("""
            As you're crouched on the trail, proudly inspecting your newfound 
            treasure, the hairs on your neck suddenly starts to rise..

            You're being watched.

            Some strange distorted noises emits from the direction you were 
            walking towards.

DEN_DEATH = ("""
You enter the pitch-black path, but since you have your flashlight you
can see just fine.
Eventually you see the narrow path ends and reveals a big, open space
surrounded by trees.
And on the other side you see... a tunnel! This must be the way out!

As you take a few steps into this strange, open space  you hear something
crunch beneath your feet.
You shine the light on your feet, and your heart drops to your stomach...
Bones, everywhere.

As you stand there, horrified by your discovery,
the sound you just made seems to have drawn unwanted attention.

You look up towards the tunnel and see the big eyes with the terrifying grin
looking at you...

DEN_SURVIVAL = ("""
You enter the pitch-black path, and your old flashligt isn't helping you see
much, but the path is easily navigated.
Soon you see the narrow path ending and you walk into a big, open space.

As you take a few steps into the open space , you hear something crunch
beneath your feet.
You shine the light on your feet, and your heart drops to your stomach...

Bones, everywhere. This must be where it lives.
Although horrified by what you've just discovered, you keep going,
and find yourself standing in front of an entrance to a tunnel.

You see the glowing eyes along with the terrifying grin appear in
the entrance before you.
But it somehow feel like it's expression has changed,
to something more distressed.

You walk towards it with your arm out holding the old flashlight to confirm
your theory, and it keeps it's distance!
Confident in that you now know your'e carrying
something special, you charge forward!

Distorted screams echoes in the tunnel as the creature is desperatly 
trying to attack or flee, and you notice that parts of its body are
in a state of decay, withering away.

Eventually the screams stops as the creature have seemed to disappear.
Dead or not, you've fought it off.

As you reach the end of the tunnel you can see city lights in the distance..

HOUSE = ("""
           You start walking, continuing south off the path. 

           After a while you arrive at a small, abandoned house.  
           You might find something useful in there, you go inside...
     
           Dusty with lots of spiderwebs, how cozy. Looks like no one has set 
           foot in there for some time.
          
           Handwritten notes and books are scattered everywhere, someone's 
           been busy.

           You wonder what whomever was here was writing about, but it seems 
           to be written in some language unkown to you.
         
           You look around...
            """)

HOUSE_ITEM = ("""
           You direct your flashlight towards the floor underneath the desk, 
           and you notice something silver sticking out from a pile of notes.
           You put your flashlight down and crouch down to pick it up. 
          
           It looks like a very old flashlight in the shape of a square with a 
           handle, you've never seen anything like it.
          
           There's some kind of switch on the back, you turn it and incredibly 
           enough, it works!

           The light it emits is weak though, and it feels very strange.. Warm 
           and comforting somehow. 
           """)

HOUSE_ENCOUNTER = ("""
           You suddenly hear twigs cracking outside the broken window. 
           Something is outside.

           You take a deep breath and look toward the broken window. 
           You see the shape of a distorted lower body, violently muscular and 
           covered in rippling shadows.

           You are frozen in horror, trying to decide what to do, when a huge 
           clawed hand splinters the window frame.
           Looks like it's about to crouch and take a look inside.
           """)

HOUSE_ENCOUNTER_OUTCOME = ("""
The creature crouches slowly, and after what feels like forever, 
a pair of eyes and an abnormally large grin glowing in white appear
in the window.

Your heart is beating so fast you feel like you could die any second
from a heart attack, but you close your eyes and stretch out your arm
as far as you can towards the creature, holding the old flashlight.

A painfully loud, distorted scream pierces your ears and then.. silence.

After a minute of silence you open your eyes, and the creature has vanished.
